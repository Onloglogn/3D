This is a repository for showing a heuristic based on Bottom Left Algorithm, for finding good solutions to pack any object. The Bottom left Algorithm puts rectangles of integer length of sides in a viable position. The position to be viable is determined by an adaptation of bottom left algorithm that allows to use on any object.
